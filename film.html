        <h1 style="text-align:center; color:cornflowerblue; font-size: 60; background-color: blanchedalmond;">Film</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center; padding: 70px;">  Film is another hobby of mine that 
            has been a part of my life for longer than I can remember. Our old family 
            harddrives are full of Photo Booth videos I would make on our family computer. 
            I started a Youtube channel when I was thirteen but it never really went anywhere. 
            Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the process of filming and editing videos and I
             decided to continue with it. My Freshman year, I created a video called “Fear” 
             for a contest between the Honors English Classes. After showing it to my class, 
             it ended up being one of the finalists. It was such an amazing experience to 
             see my peers get excited about being on the big screen. After that, I decided 
             to keep creating video montages of anything and everything. </p>
