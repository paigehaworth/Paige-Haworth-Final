        <h1 style="text-align:center; color:cornflowerblue; font-size: 60; background-color: blanchedalmond;">Publication Design</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center; padding: 70px;">  Since my freshman year of high school, 
            I have been working on my high school's literary and art magazine, Menagerie. 
            Being on the art staff, I work hands-on with Adobe InDesign to design the layout 
            of the pages and decide what art goes with the literary pieces. By junior year I 
            held the position as Art Editor. As COVID-19 took over and school went fully 
            remote, I ended up working with 3 other people to complete the whole book. 
            Together, we designed over 70 pages from home and worked together to produce 
            the best book we could while in a whole new environment. As a senior, I was 
            the Editor-in-Chief of the magazine and I was able to lead a creative staff to put out a well rounded magazine. 
            Additionally, I have been working on my schoolâ€™s yearbook staff as a designer 
            and the Senior Ad Editor. Throughout my junior and senior year, I have worked 
            with 29 other students on the staff to create over 300 pages. Using all Adobe 
            Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign, I create mods (excerpts or sidebars that 
            provide support for the main story with additional information and visuals) and 
            design the layout of each page to highlight the students and faculty as well as 
            the sports and clubs that are offered at our school. It has been such a unique 
            learning opportunity and has taught me the importance of communication in a 
            collaborative environment.</p>
