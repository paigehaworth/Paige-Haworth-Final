        <h1 style="text-align:center; color:cornflowerblue; font-size: 60; background-color: blanchedalmond;">Merch</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center; padding: 70px;"> In October 2020 I collaborated with TikTok creator Josh Larson, @larsjosh, who has 
            over 400k followers, to design merchandise for his followers. Josh released three o
            f the designs I created. Since December, he has sold over 500 pieces of merch and 
            the numbers continue to grow. Following the release of Joshâ€™s merch, I worked with 
            Alex Sedlak who as @alexsedlak1 on Tiktok, has 1.2 million followers. 
            Alex released five of the designs I created and the outcome was again a success. 
            I look forward to working with more creators in the future and continue 
            to collaborate to promote their brand for their supporters.</p>
